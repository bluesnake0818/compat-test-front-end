# Chinese Zodiac Compatibility Analysis

## A MERN Stack CRUD Application

## Why I Started This
- I started this course with the short-term goal of building a new website for my startup, a social discovery platform matching users based on their Chinese zodiac.
- Over the course of the past year, I realized that the awareness of Chinese Astrology in the West was really poor. A lot of people knew there are 12 zodiacs and thatâ€™s about it. 
- So instead of a boring and static website that we have right now built by an outsourced engineer, I decided to build websites to that can directly engage with users applying my marketing hypotheses dynamically. 
- The first two apps are targeted at Top of Funnel users. The first one was Chinese Zodiac slot machine game, and the second one was a comparison between the western zodiac and eastern zodiac. They were essentially creating a bridge between a familiar concept and a new concept. They are intended to raise awareness - to let them know we are out there. 
- The third app (this app) provides mored personalized information targeted at potential users further down the funnel. They can begin to personally relate to what we offer and eventually and hopefully to our brand. This is further down the funnel about middle of the funnel. Everything I build here will eventually become one coherent funnel that leads to the app.  
- So compatibility is at the core of what Eastern astrology offers, because it was primarily used for matrimony in the past. Then character analysis and horoscopes make up the other two pillars of the tripod of Eastern astrology. I have just a little bit of compatibility and character analysis content up as of now, but will eventually populate the app with more content from all of these three sections.

## Challenges
- Too many files are open and hard to keep track of them --> will probably get better at it with better organization
- Getting the grasp of useState() / useEffect()
- Getting used to the structure of de-coupled app / react
- Time difference (engineering channel often required real-time feedback in this unit)
- Uploading content - a lot of tedious manual labor
- Deployment - Heroku!
- Accessing array vs. object.. when coupled with re-redering (useState, useEffect)... it was difficult to debug 

## Next Steps (backlog)
- More personalized content - horoscopes, character analysis
- Personality Tests
- Personalized Profiles
- Allow friendship
- Pagination
- Overflow scroll
- Daily Compatibility updates
- Year Zodiac --> Day Zodiac
- Messaging system, Community Board
- Upload more info (Zodiac, Compat, Story)
- Bug fixes
- Desktop responsive
