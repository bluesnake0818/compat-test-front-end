It may take some time to get a steady fire going, but once you do, you'll enjoy the warmth of a friendship that will feel much like huddling around a campfire, roasting marshmallows and sharing secrets under a starry sky.",
  //   'horse': "You might not be the most demonstrative of friends, but why would you need to be? Your solid connection, built upon a deep and implicit understanding of each other, doesn't need words to make itself felt. All the same, it never hurts to let a buddy know how much they mean to you. You can even say 'don't be weird about it' after, if you must.",

  //   'dog': "Your similarities gift you with a deep and instinctive understanding of each other, but this can prove draining; whenever you're rattled by the sight of your insecurities mirrored back at you, focus on each other's strengths and try to help each other grow. Learning from these moments will prove to be invaluable healing experiences for you both.",
  //   'pig': "Your friendship promises to be a bit of a rollercoaster ride, full of ups and downs and hurtling twists. While the drops may leave you feeling blindsided and dazed, the spectacular highs will bring you back together again.
