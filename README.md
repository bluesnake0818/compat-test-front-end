## Why I Started This
- Continuing from Unit 1 and 2, I built this app for marketing my app, a Chinese zodiac-based friend discovery app, and raise awareness of/build interest in Chinese astrology in the US.
- Unit 1 & 2 more for Top of Funnel users
- This is app is more focused on down the funnel (middle of the funnel) From this point forward, it's more content education
- Content-wise, compatibilty is the core. there will be horoscope, compat, and personality content. 
- They will all come together at the end.
